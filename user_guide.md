# QuLab: Visualizing Quicksort

This codelab will guide you through using the QuLab application to visualize the Quicksort algorithm. Quicksort is a widely used, efficient sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy. Understanding how Quicksort works is fundamental in computer science. This application provides an interactive way to learn and observe the algorithm in action. By adjusting array sizes and pivot selection strategies, you will gain valuable insights into Quicksort's behavior and performance.

## Understanding the Application Interface
Duration: 00:05

Let's familiarize ourselves with the application's user interface. Upon launching the application, you will notice a sidebar on the left and the main content area on the right. The sidebar contains controls for configuring the Quicksort visualization, while the main area displays the visualization itself.

The key components are:

*   **Navigation:** A selectbox in the sidebar to navigate to "Quicksort Visualizer" page.
*   **Array Configuration:** Allows you to control the size of the array to be sorted using a slider.
*   **Pivot Selection Strategy:** A dropdown menu to choose the pivot selection method. Options include "First", "Last", and "Random".
*   **Start Quicksort Button:** Triggers the Quicksort algorithm and visualizes each step.
*   **Visualization Area:** The main area where the bar chart visualization of the Quicksort steps are displayed.

## Configuring the Array
Duration: 00:03

The first step is to configure the array that will be sorted. In the sidebar, you'll find the "Array Configuration" section.

1.  **Array Size:** Use the slider to select the desired size of the array. You can choose a size between 5 and 20 elements. A smaller array will allow you to observe the sorting process more easily.

The application will automatically generate a random array of integers within the range of 1 to 100 based on the selected array size.

## Selecting the Pivot Strategy
Duration: 00:05

A crucial aspect of Quicksort is the selection of a pivot element. The pivot is used to divide the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. The choice of pivot strategy can significantly impact Quicksort's performance.

1.  **Pivot Selection Strategy:** Use the dropdown menu to choose one of the following pivot selection strategies:
    *   **First:** The first element of the array is chosen as the pivot.
    *   **Last:** The last element of the array is chosen as the pivot.
    *   **Random:** A random element from the array is chosen as the pivot.

Experimenting with different pivot strategies can help you understand their effect on the number of comparisons and swaps performed by Quicksort.

Choosing the "First" or "Last" element as the pivot can lead to worst-case performance (O(n^2)) when the array is already sorted or nearly sorted.

## Running the Quicksort Visualization
Duration: 00:10

Now that you have configured the array and selected a pivot strategy, you can run the Quicksort visualization.

1.  **Start Quicksort:** Click the "Start Quicksort" button.

The application will then execute the Quicksort algorithm on the generated array and display each step of the sorting process as a bar chart. The pivot element for each step will be highlighted in red. Observe how the array is partitioned and how the sub-arrays are recursively sorted. Each step is briefly delayed, allowing you to visually follow the sorting process.

By observing the visualization, you will understand:

*   How the pivot is used to partition the array.
*   How the sub-arrays are recursively sorted.
*   The effect of the pivot strategy on the sorting process.

Pay attention to the movement of elements during each step of the Quicksort algorithm. This interactive approach will solidify your understanding of the Quicksort algorithm.

## Interpreting the Visualization
Duration: 00:07

Each step of the Quicksort algorithm is represented as a bar chart. The height of each bar corresponds to the value of the element in the array. The pivot element for each step is highlighted.

Observe how the array is divided into sub-arrays around the pivot element. Elements smaller than the pivot are moved to the left, and elements larger than the pivot are moved to the right. The highlighted pivot in red helps you identify the element being used to partition the array at each step.

By carefully observing the visualization, you can trace the execution of the Quicksort algorithm and understand how it sorts the array.

## Experimenting and Learning
Duration: 00:10

The best way to learn about Quicksort is to experiment with different configurations and observe the results.

Try the following:

*   **Vary the Array Size:** Increase or decrease the array size to see how it affects the number of steps required to sort the array.
*   **Compare Pivot Strategies:** Try different pivot strategies (First, Last, Random) and observe how they affect the sorting process. Note any differences in performance or behavior.
*   **Identify Best and Worst Cases:** Try to create arrays that result in the best-case and worst-case scenarios for each pivot strategy. For example, a nearly sorted array with the "First" or "Last" pivot strategy will demonstrate worst-case performance.

Repeatedly using the application with different configurations will reinforce your understanding of the Quicksort algorithm and its performance characteristics.
